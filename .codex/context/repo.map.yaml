  name: automaker
  purpose: Orchestrate AI agents to implement software features using a UI, a local HTTP API, and isolated git worktrees.
interfaces:
  - Electron desktop app (apps/ui)
  - Web UI (apps/ui web mode)
  - HTTP + WebSocket API (apps/server)
layers:
  - ui-electron: React/Vite UI, Electron main/preload, HTTP client, E2E tests
  - server-core: Express API, auth, event streaming, terminal WS
  - agent-orchestration: AgentService, AutoMode, pipeline/backlog plan, providers, prompts
  - system-io-storage: file-based data, context files, secure fs, terminal sessions
  - git-worktrees: worktree creation, git operations, PR/branch helpers
  - shared-libs: types, platform, utils, model/dependency resolver, prompts, git-utils
core_responsibilities:
  - Manage feature lifecycle (create, run, verify, approve, commit)
  - Run AI agents via Claude Agent SDK with event streaming
  - Maintain project and global data on disk (no database)
  - Isolate changes in git worktrees and support review/merge
non_goals:
  - Provide a hosted multi-tenant service or SaaS backend
  - Use a centralized database for core data
